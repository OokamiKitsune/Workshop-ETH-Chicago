// This TypeScript file is a templated example of how to set your name and class on the ToolTip.
// You will need to Copy the code below.
// Create a new file in the same directory where this file is "components/developers" and name your new file developer<YourName>.ts
// Replace <YourName> with your name. For example, if your name is Gandalf, then the file name would be developerGandalf.ts üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
// Then you will replace the name and class properties below with your name and class.
// You will then import this file into the tool-tip-quest.tsx to call your own name and class.


// If your name is Gandalf then your developerGandalf.ts file should look like to this:

const developerGandalf = {
    name: "Gandalf",
    characterClass: "Wizard",
};

export default developerGandalf;
